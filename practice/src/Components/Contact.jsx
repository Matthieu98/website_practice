          <h1>Contact Me</h1>
          <p>
            If you're here then that's a good sign! You probably found something
            interesting somewhere on this website and now you want to reach out,
            awesome I'd love to hear from you!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h5>Email</h5>
          <p>
            I have two emails that I can be reached at:
            matthieutapolsky@gmail.com and tapolsky@bc.edu
          </p>
          <p>
            I know I know it's sad that they don't open up an email to me but
            really who uses the mail client anymore? I mean I do but I feel like
            nobody else does so it was an executive decision.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

export default Contact;
