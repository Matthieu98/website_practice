          <h4>Brief History</h4>
          <p>
            I was born in Houston Texas in the Woodlands and lived there for a
            little over a year before I moved to Boulder Colorado. I lived there
            for 10 years and loved every minute of it until we moved to
            Louisville Kentucky right after I finished elementary school. At
            first I hated Kentucky, it was too humid and my skin felt like it
            was crawling, but I'm happy we moved looking back now because it has
            really helped shape who I have become. We got a dog as a guilt
            present from our parents whcih was amazing and I have made many good
            friends. Now I am an upcoming junior at Boston College and am super
            excited for whats to come.

          <h4>Programming History</h4>
          <p>
            I started programming as a junior in High School taking a block
            programming class that I had a hate love relationship with. It was
            incredibly boring but it introduced me to the field I now love.
            Since then I decided I wanted to be a developer and haven't look
            back since. I have completed Code Louisville, have had two
            internships since beginning college, and have make the prototype of
            an app(check out my resume for more info!). I've loved, almost,
            every minute since I started and can't wait to keep learning and
            expanding my skillset.

          <h4>Hobbies & Interests</h4>
          <p>
            I enjoy playing squash and am on my school's squash team. I started
            playing in high school with my dad for fun but quickly found that I
            loved the sport. I enjoy rock climbing, playing soccer, playing
            squash, hiking, camping, reading, and running but don't do enough of
            any of them because I always think of what I should do next instead
            of actually just doing it.

          <h4>School Life</h4>
          <p>
            At school I am the Vice-Chair of the Student Organization Funding
            Committee which is an organization that receives money from the
            school to then allocate to all of the student organzations on
            campus. I am the Financial Advisor of the sqaush team, and am on the
            team. I am the treasurer of the student organzation Canvases of Care
            which goes to nursing homes and paints art for the residents in
            order to try to make their stay happier. I am a manager in Catering
            at Boston College and also work in at the desk in the Computer
            Science Department helping to answer any questions students have
            about the major/minor and their requirements as well as about
            different professors hours and office locations. Then I enjoy
            hanging out with any of my 6 roommates or other friends either
            eating food, playing super smash bros, or listening to music.
