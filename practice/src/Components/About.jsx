          <h4>Brief History</h4>
          <p>
            I was born in Houston Texas in the Woodlands and lived there for a
            little over a year before I moved to Boulder Colorado. I lived there
            for 10 years and loved every minute of it until we moved to
            Louisville Kentucky right after I finished elementary school. At
            first I hated Kentucky, it was too humid and my skin felt like it
            was crawling, but I'm happy we moved looking back now because it has
            really helped shape who I have become. We got a dog as a guilt
            present from our parents whcih was amazing and I have made many good
            friends. Now I am an upcoming junior at Boston College and am super
            excited for whats to come.

          <h4>Programming History</h4>
          <p>
            I started programming as a junior in High School taking a block
            programming class that I had a hate love relationship with. It was
            incredibly boring but it introduced me to the field I now love.
            Since then I decided I wanted to be a developer and haven't look
            back since. I have completed Code Louisville, have had two
            internships since beginning college, and have make the prototype of
            an app(check out my resume for more info!). I've loved, almost,
            every minute since I started and can't wait to keep learning and
            expanding my skillset.
